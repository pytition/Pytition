# Pytition

## Why using Pytition?

* Because it allows you to host petitions without compromising the privacy of your signatories.
* No tracking, ever: CSS, JS and all resources are self-hosted. Pytition does not use CDN.
* Nice UI: Bootstrap 4 + JQuery 3.
* Based on solid backend technology: Django.
* Responsive UI: works well on phones/tablets/laptops/desktops.
* If you host an instance of Pytition, you can guarantee your signatories that their informations won't leak to third parties.
* It is Open Source and Free Software.

## Features

* [x] Multi-lingual UI with i18n: English, French, Italian, Occitan, Spanish.

* [x] You can propose your signatories to subscribe to a newsletter/mailinglist (via HTTP GET/POST or EMAIL methods).

* [x] Support for several organizations on the same Pytition instance [v2.0](https://github.com/pytition/Pytition/milestone/2)
