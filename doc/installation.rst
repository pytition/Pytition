Installation
************

Manual installation (recommended for production)
================================================

Install system dependencies:

On Debian derivatives
---------------------

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt install git virtualenv python3-dev build-essential mariadb-server gettext libzip-dev libssl-dev

On Ubuntu 18.04 LTS you need to install libmariadbclient-dev:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo apt install libmariadbclient-dev

On Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and later you need to install libmariadb-dev-compat:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo apt install libmariadb-dev-compat

On Centos/Fedora derivatives
----------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo yum install MariaDB-server galera-4 MariaDB-client MariaDB-shared MariaDB-backup MariaDB-common git python3 python3-virtualenv make gcc gettext

On Arch Linux
-------------

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo pacman -S mariadb mariadb-libs python make gcc gettext

Install pdm
-----------

See https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/#installation

Get the source, configure and initialize Pytition
-------------------------------------------------

Get the latest release git tag:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ version=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/pytition/pytition/releases/latest | grep "tag_name" | cut -d : -f2,3 | tr -d \" | tr -d ,)


Create a directory to host your Pytition instance and it's static files:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ mkdir -p www/static www/mediaroot

Clone Pytition git repository and checkout latest release:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd www
  $ git clone https://github.com/pytition/pytition
  $ cd pytition
  $ git checkout $version

Install Pytition's dependencies and enter the virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pdm self update # update pdm to latest version
  $ pdm sync --clean
  $ eval $(pdm venv activate)

Create a MySQL database and user for Pytition:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ password="ENTER_A_SECURE_PASSWORD_YOU_WILL_REMEMBER_HERE"
  $ sudo mysql -h localhost -u root -Bse "CREATE USER pytition@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '${password}'; CREATE DATABASE pytition; GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'pytition'@localhost; GRANT ALL privileges ON pytition.* TO pytition@localhost; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"

Write your SQL credential file in `my.cnf` outside of `www`::

  [client]
  database = pytition
  user = pytition
  password = YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
  default-character-set = utf8

If your SQL server is MariaDB <= 10.2.1, you need to setup your SQL server to use table format compatible with larger-than-767-bytes columns. From 10.2.2 onward, row format is already DYNAMIC by default.
So, if you have an old MariaDB, add the following lines after `[server]` in `/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf` (This path is for Ubuntu 18.04)::

  innodb_large_prefix=true
  innodb_file_format=barracuda
  innodb_file_per_table=true
  innodb_default_row_format=DYNAMIC


Create your Pytition instance config file by copying the example one:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd www/pytition
  $ cp pytition/pytition/settings/config_example.py pytition/pytition/settings/config.py

Now you can edit your config file in `pytition/pytition/settings/config.py` according to :ref:`Configuration`.

You **must** *at least* configure the settings described in the :ref:`Mandatory settings<mandatory settings>` section of the :ref:`Configuration` page.

Those are:

.. hlist::

  * SECRET_KEY
  * STATIC_URL
  * STATIC_ROOT
  * MEDIA_URL
  * MEDIA_ROOT
  * DATABASES
  * ALLOWED_HOSTS

.. note:: Do not forget to put a correct path to your `my.cnf` MySQL credential file in your config `DATABASES` setting.

Initialize Pytition project database. Pay attention to be in your virtualenv to enter the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd www/pytition/pytition
  $ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="pytition.settings.config"
  $ python3 manage.py migrate
  $ python3 manage.py collectstatic
  $ python3 manage.py compilemessages
  $ python3 manage.py createsuperuser

.. note:: You will be asked to enter a `username`, `email` and `password` for the administrator's account.

Before trying to configure a web server you can try to see if your configuration is OK by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ DEBUG=1 DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=pytition.settings.config python3 ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

You can then point your browser to `http://yourdomain.tld:8000` and check that you can see Pytition's home page and log-in with your newly created admin account.

.. warning:: If you've set ``USE_MAIL_QUEUE`` to ``True`` and ``MAIL_EXTERNAL_CRON_SET`` to ``False``, running Pytition via ``manage.py runserver`` might not work well since you need to be run via `uwsgi`. Especially emails might not be sent.

.. note:: If you switch ``USE_MAIL_QUEUE`` from ``False`` to ``True`` at some point, you might have to re-run ``python3 manage.py migrate`` to create the database structures needed for the mail queues.

Configure your web server
-------------------------

Nginx + uwsgi (recommended)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First install Nginx web server:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo apt install nginx

Here is an example of Nginx configuration that you can put in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/pytition`::

  server {
    server_name pytition.mydomain.tld;
    keepalive_timeout   70;

    location / {
      include         uwsgi_params;
      uwsgi_pass      unix:/var/run/uwsgi/app/pytition/socket;
    }
    location /static {
      alias /home/pytition/www/static;
    }

    location /mediaroot {
      alias /home/pytition/www/mediaroot;
    }

    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/pytition.mydomain.tld/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/pytition.mydomain.tld/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
  }

  server {
    server_name pytition.mydomain.tld;
    listen 80;
    return 301 https://pytition.mydomain.tld$request_uri;
  }

The previous example automatically redirects HTTP/80 to HTTPS/443 and uses Let's Encrypt generated certificate.

Enable your new Nginx config:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pytition /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/pytition
  $ sudo systemctl reload nginx

Install uwsgi dependency::

  sudo apt install uwsgi uwsgi-plugin-python3 python3-uwsgidecorators

Put the UNIX user of your install in `www-data` group (for Debian like systems) if your user wasn't `www-data` already. For instance in our case we use the `pytition` unix username:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo usermod -a -G pytition www-data


Give both uwsgi and nginx access to your mediaroot directory:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo chown -R pytition:www-data /home/pytition/www/mediaroot


Now let's create our uwsgi configuration in `/etc/uwsgi/apps-available/pytition.ini`::

  [uwsgi]
  chdir = /home/pytition/www/pytition/pytition
  module = pytition.wsgi
  home = /home/pytition/www/pytition/.venv
  master = true
  processes = 10
  vacuum = true
  socket = /run/uwsgi/app/pytition/socket
  uid = ENTER_HERE_PYTITION_UNIX_USER
  gid = www-data
  chmod-socket = 664
  plugins = python3
  env = DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=pytition.settings.config


.. note::

  The uwsgi configuration (`pytition.ini`) file's `home` value must be set to your pdm virtual env path. You can have pdm display the venv path using this command while being in the pytition source code top level directory:
  `pdm venv list`.

Create a symlink to enable or uwsgi configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo ln -s /etc/uwsgi/apps-available/pytition.ini /etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled/pytition.ini

Start uwsgi and nginx servers:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo systemctl restart uwsgi
  $ sudo systemctl restart nginx

Your Pytition home page should be available over there: http://mydomain.tld

Now it's time to :ref:`Configure<Configuration>` your Pytition instance the way you want!

Installation via Docker (recommended for development)
=====================================================

.. warning:: Please, do **NOT** use this in production. You would have tons of security and performance issues. You could lose your SECRET_KEY, you would run with Django's DEBUG setting enabled, you would be serving static files via Django basic webserver. You would be running with no HTTPS possibility at all. etc etc. Please : don't.

Clone latest development version of Pytition:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git clone https://github.com/pytition/pytition

Install docker and docker-compose:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose

Put your user in the docker group (needed for Ubuntu 18.04) and start docker daemon:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
  $ # log-in again as your user for group change to take effect
  $ # or just type the following line
  $ su -l $USER
  $ sudo systemctl enable docker
  $ sudo systemctl start docker

For the first run you need to create the database container and let it be ready:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ docker-compose up --build db

Wait until it prints something like::

  LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections

Then hit ^C (ctrl+C) to shutdown the database container.

From now on, you can just type this to run Pytition in a container:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ docker-compose up --build

Last command before being able to click on the "http://0.0.0.0:8000/" link that the "web" container prints to out on the console. You need to run migrations, install static files, compile language files, create an admin account and lastly populate your database with some dummy data. You can do all of this with the `dev/initialize.sh` script:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ docker-compose exec web pdm run ./dev/initialize.sh

Aaaand that's it! You can now just click on the links:

- http://0.0.0.0:8000/ for the Pytition interface
- http://0.0.0.0:8080/ for the mail server web interface

Next time, just run ``$ docker-compose up --build``
